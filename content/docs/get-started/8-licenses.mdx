# Understanding Open Source Licenses

Open source licenses define **how code can be used, modified, and distributed**.
Understanding licenses is essential for contributors and maintainers alike to avoid legal or ethical issues.

---

## 1. Why Licenses Matter

- Legally protects the author and contributors.
- Defines permissions for use, modification, and redistribution.
- Ensures open collaboration while respecting authors’ rights.
- Some licenses require sharing improvements (copyleft), while others are permissive.

---

## 2. Common Open Source Licenses

### 2.1 MIT License
- **Type:** Permissive
- **Allows:** Use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense
- **Requires:** Include the original license notice
- **Example projects:** React, Vue.js

---

### 2.2 Apache 2.0 License
- **Type:** Permissive with patent grant
- **Allows:** Similar to MIT, plus patent rights
- **Requires:** Include license and NOTICE file
- **Example projects:** Apache Kafka, Android Open Source

---

### 2.3 GPL (General Public License)
- **Type:** Copyleft
- **Requires:** Any derivative work must be licensed under GPL
- **Version:** GPLv2, GPLv3
- **Example projects:** Linux kernel, GIMP

---

### 2.4 Other Licenses
- **BSD 2-Clause / 3-Clause** → permissive, minimal requirements
- **Creative Commons** → mainly for content and documentation
- **LGPL** → less strict copyleft for libraries

---

## 3. How to Respect Licenses as a Contributor

- Always check the repo’s license before contributing.
- Include license headers if required by the project.
- Don’t relicense someone else’s work without permission.
- For code reuse, follow license requirements (e.g., attribution, copyleft rules).

---

## 4. Choosing a License for Your Project

- Decide based on your goals:
  - Permissive (MIT, Apache) → allow wide adoption
  - Copyleft (GPL) → ensure derivatives remain open source
- Consider compatibility with dependencies.
- Clearly add `LICENSE` file in the repo root.

---

## 5. Tools to Check and Manage Licenses

- [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com), [Licenseinator](https://licenseinator.vercel.app/) → helps pick a license.
- `license-checker` (npm) → detect dependencies’ licenses.
- GitHub repository settings → display license badge.

---

## 6. Summary

- Licenses are **legal rules for open source projects**.
- Permissive licenses allow flexibility; copyleft ensures derivatives remain open.
- Always read, respect, and include licenses in contributions.
