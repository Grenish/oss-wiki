# Dos and Don’ts

Contributing to open source isn’t just about pushing code — it’s about discipline, clarity, and professionalism.
Your workflow reflects your respect for the project and the maintainers’ time.
Below are essential **Dos** and **Don’ts** every developer should follow to maintain a clean, reliable, and respectful Git and GitHub workflow.

- **Use meaningful commit messages**
  Always describe *why* you made a change, not just *what* changed.
  Example:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Refactor login handler to improve validation and error clarity"
  ```

* **Create feature branches**
  Avoid committing directly to `main`. Instead, create dedicated branches for features or fixes.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b fix/update-doc-links
  ```

* **Pull before pushing**
  Always pull the latest updates before pushing to prevent merge conflicts.

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

* **Keep commits atomic and focused**
  Each commit should represent one logical change. Avoid mixing unrelated modifications.

* **Review before committing**
  Use `git diff` or your IDE’s VCS tools to review changes before committing. Small mistakes are easier to catch early.

* **Write descriptive pull requests (PRs)**
  A high-quality PR includes:

  * A clear title summarizing the change.
  * A detailed description explaining **what** and **why**.
  * References to related issues (if any).
  * Screenshots or test results (for UI or behavioral changes).
    Example:

  > ### Added improved error messages for login failures
  >
  > * Refactored error handler to display user-friendly messages.
  > * Linked to Issue #42.
  > * Tested across Chrome and Firefox.

* **Use `.gitignore` properly**
  Exclude environment files, system configurations, and build artifacts (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`, `.idea`).

* **Use rebase for clean history**
  When your branch is behind main:

  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  ```

  This keeps your commit history clean and linear.

* **Be respectful during code reviews**
  Reviews should focus on code quality, not personal criticism.
  Use positive, professional language.

* **Don’t commit large binaries or generated files**
  Repositories are for source code, not build outputs, media, or dependencies.

* **Don’t push directly to main**
  Always work through pull requests for transparency and review.

* **Don’t commit sensitive data**
  Never commit `.env` files, credentials, or access tokens. Once pushed, they’re exposed permanently.

* **Don’t write vague commit messages**
  Avoid generic messages like `update`, `fix`, or `changes`. They’re useless in debugging and reviewing.

* **Don’t force push to shared branches**
  It overwrites history and can cause data loss. Use `--force` only on your personal feature branches.

* **Don’t ignore conflicts**
  Resolve merge conflicts thoughtfully. Blindly accepting one side can overwrite critical work.

* **Don’t spam PRs for minor or irrelevant edits**
  Submitting dozens of PRs for typos or trivial spacing changes wastes maintainers’ time.

* **Don’t skip testing**
  Always test locally before submitting — especially if your changes impact functionality or UI.

* **Don’t copy code without credit**
  Respect open-source licenses. Always cite or credit the original authors when reusing code.

## Understanding Pull Request Effort Levels

Not all PRs are equal — and that’s fine. What matters is **intent, effort, and professionalism**.
Below is a distinction between **Good Effort PRs** and **Low Effort PRs**, so you understand what maintainers value.

### Good Effort PR (High-Quality Contribution)

A **Good Effort PR** demonstrates thought, testing, and clear communication.

**Traits:**

* Addresses a meaningful issue or adds clear value.
* Includes a descriptive title and detailed explanation.
* Contains **well-structured, clean code** or relevant documentation improvements.
* Passes tests or includes test updates.
* Uses proper commit conventions and branch naming.
* Doesn’t break existing functionality.
* Responds to review feedback respectfully and promptly.

**Example:**

> * Fixes broken navigation links and updates documentation structure.
> * Adds context-aware navigation for `/docs` and `/tutorials`.
> * Improves accessibility for mobile users.
> * Linked to Issue #134.

Such PRs save maintainers time, build trust, and often get merged quickly.

### Low Effort PR (Unprofessional Contribution)

A **Low Effort PR** shows little consideration for maintainers, project standards, or actual value.

**Traits:**

* No description or unclear purpose.
* Fixes a typo or changes whitespace without reason.
* Includes unrelated or random edits (e.g., adding your name unnecessarily).
* Commits generated files, build folders, or `.idea` configs.
* Breaks the codebase or ignores linting rules.
* Copies code without understanding or context.
* Responds poorly to feedback (e.g., defensive or dismissive).

**Example:**

> * Added my name to README.
> * Changed formatting of random file.
> * Committed `.vscode/` folder accidentally.

Such PRs are usually closed without merging and may harm your reputation as a contributor.

## Final Advice

Professionalism in open source is about respect — for your time, for others’ time, and for the shared codebase.
A well-crafted pull request is **not just code** — it’s communication, documentation, and collaboration combined.

> Open source doesn’t just teach you how to code. It teaches you how to contribute responsibly.
