### Introduction

Commit messages are the **journal of your project’s history**. They explain *what* changed and *why*, making it easier to track progress, debug issues, and review code later. Poorly written commits create confusion. Well-written ones tell a story.

-----

### Why Good Commit Messages Matter

  * **Easier debugging and version tracking:** A clear history helps you quickly pinpoint when and where a bug was introduced.
  * **Simpler code reviews and PR discussions:** Reviewers can understand your changes without having to read every line of code.
  * **Enables changelog generation and semantic versioning:** Automated tools can use your commit messages to generate release notes and determine the next version number.
  * **Communicates intent clearly:** Your teammates and maintainers instantly understand the purpose of your changes.

-----

### The Golden Rules of Commit Messages

1.  **Use the imperative mood:** Write as if you're giving a command.

      * <CircleCheck className="inline h-4 w-4 text-green-500" /> "Add login validation"
      * <CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> "Added login validation" or "Adding login validation"

2.  **Keep it short and descriptive:** The subject line should be a brief summary of the change, ideally limited to **50 characters or less**.

3.  **Capitalize the first letter** of the subject line.

      * <CircleCheck className="inline h-4 w-4 text-green-500" /> "Fix navbar overflow"
      * <CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> "fix navbar overflow"

4.  **Don't end with a period** in the subject line.

      * <CircleCheck className="inline h-4 w-4 text-green-500" /> `Update dependencies`
      * <CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> `Update dependencies.`

5.  **Explain why, not just what, in the body.** The subject line explains **what** changed, and the body provides the crucial **why** and **how**. This is essential for major updates.

### Example of a Well-Structured Commit Message

```text
feat(auth): add password reset via email

- Added new /forgot-password API endpoint
- Integrated email verification and token validation
- Updated UI for password reset flow

Closes #42
```

### Understanding Conventional Commits

Conventional Commits provide a standardized way to structure messages. This enables automation tools to generate changelogs, version bumps, and release notes automatically.

#### **Format**

```text
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

#### **Example**

```bash
git commit -m "fix(ui): align login button in header"
```

#### **Common Types**

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`feat`** | Introduces a new feature to the codebase. |
| **`fix`** | Fixes a bug in the codebase. |
| **`docs`** | Documentation changes only. |
| **`style`** | Code style updates (no logic changes). |
| **`refactor`**| A code restructuring or rewrite. |
| **`test`** | Adds or updates tests. |
| **`chore`** | Maintenance tasks like dependency updates. |
| **`perf`** | Performance improvements. |
| **`ci`** | Changes to CI/CD configuration files. |
| **`build`** | Changes to the build system or external dependencies. |

#### **Commit Message Structure Breakdown**

```text
feat(ui): add dark mode toggle

Added a dark mode switch to the header.
Improved accessibility by adjusting contrast ratios.

BREAKING CHANGE: Theme settings are now user-specific.
```

  * **`feat(ui)`**: **Type** (`feat` for a new feature) and **optional scope** (`ui` for user interface).
  * **`add dark mode toggle`**: A short, clear **description**.
  * **Body**: The long-form explanation of the **reasoning** and **details** of the change.
  * **`BREAKING CHANGE`**: A special footer that signals an incompatible API change. This is crucial for automated semantic versioning.

### Using Tools for Better Commits

You can use these tools to enforce the Conventional Commits standard and maintain consistency across your project.

1.  **Commitizen:** An interactive CLI tool that prompts you to fill in all the required parts of a conventional commit.

    ```bash
    npm install -g commitizen
    # Run interactive prompts with:
    git cz
    ```

2.  **Commitlint:** A linter for your commit messages. It checks if your message follows the configured rules before the commit is finalized.

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli}
    # Add this to commitlint.config.js
    module.exports = { extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'] };
    ```

3.  **Husky:** A tool that lets you set up Git hooks, so you can automatically run **Commitlint** before every commit.

    ```bash
    npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no-install commitlint --edit "$1"'
    ```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

  * <CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> **Using vague messages:** Avoid `update`, `fix bug`, or `misc changes`.
  * <CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> **Bundling multiple unrelated changes** in one commit. Each commit should be a single, logical change.
  * <CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> **Skipping the body** for major updates or complex changes.
  * <CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> **Ignoring CI or linter errors** related to your commit message.

-----

### Good vs. Bad Examples

| Bad Commit | Good Commit |
| :--- | :--- |
| `fix stuff` | `fix(auth): correct JWT expiration logic` |
| `add files` | `feat(ui): add responsive layout for dashboard`|
| `update` | `docs(readme): clarify setup instructions` |

### Summary

A strong commit message is:

  * **Consistent:** It follows a clear, predictable pattern.
  * **Descriptive:** It tells both what changed and why.
  * **Actionable:** It makes history readable and enables automation.

Writing good commits is a small effort with a big payoff—it turns your Git history into a reliable and searchable form of documentation.
