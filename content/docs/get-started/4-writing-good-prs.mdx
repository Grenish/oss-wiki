### Introduction

A Pull Request (PR) is your proposal to merge code into a project’s main branch. A well-written PR communicates clearly, saves reviewers time, and shows respect for maintainers. Good PRs build trust — bad ones slow projects down.

-----

### Why Good PRs Matter

  * **Maintainers can review and merge faster:** Clear and concise PRs allow maintainers to quickly understand the proposed changes and assess their impact, leading to a more efficient workflow.
  * **Reduces misunderstandings and unnecessary back-and-forth:** A detailed description and clear context prevent confusion and reduce the need for clarifying questions.
  * **Demonstrates professionalism and collaboration:** Submitting a high-quality PR shows that you value the project and the time of other contributors.
  * **Increases your credibility as a contributor:** Consistently submitting good PRs establishes you as a reliable and professional collaborator.

### Anatomy of a Good Pull Request

#### 1\. **Descriptive Title**

Your PR title should follow a consistent convention, like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), to summarize what it does—not just “update” or “fix.”

<CircleCheck className="inline h-4 w-4 text-green-500" /> `feat(auth): add password reset flow`

<CircleCheck className="inline h-4 w-4 text-green-500" /> `fix(ui): align buttons in signup form`

<CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> `Update stuff`

<CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> `Fix bug`

#### 2\. **Clear Description**

Explain the *why*, *what*, and *how* of your changes. Use a template to ensure all necessary information is included.

**Example Template:**

```text
### Summary
Briefly explain what this PR does.

### Motivation
Why is this change necessary? What problem does it solve?

### Changes Made
- List of key changes or files modified

### Testing
How did you test this feature? (e.g., manual testing, unit tests, integration tests)

### Related Issues
Closes #
```

#### 3\. **Atomic, Focused Changes**

Each PR should solve **one problem** or introduce **one feature**. This keeps the PR easy to review and prevents unrelated changes from being merged accidentally.

<CircleCheck className="inline h-4 w-4 text-green-500" /> `Add dark mode toggle`

<CircleX className="inline h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> `Fix login bug + add theme switcher + update docs`

#### 4\. **Small and Reviewable**

Keep PRs **short and focused**. Large PRs are harder to review, slower to merge, and more likely to introduce bugs.

**Tip:** Break large features into smaller, incremental PRs that build on one another.

#### 5\. **Screenshots or Demos (if UI changes)**

For any visual updates, include screenshots or short GIFs. This helps reviewers understand the impact without having to pull your branch locally.

#### 6\. **Link Related Issues**

Always link related issues using GitHub keywords (`Closes #42`, `Fixes #108`, `Related to #215`). This automatically updates the issue status when the PR is merged.

#### 7\. **Follow Code Style and Project Conventions**

Before pushing, ensure your code adheres to the project's style guide.

  * Run any linting or formatting tools (`eslint`, `prettier`).
  * Respect the project’s commit message rules (e.g., Conventional Commits).
  * Maintain a meaningful commit history (avoid messages like `Update file`).

### Low-Effort vs. Good-Effort PRs

| Aspect | Low-Effort PR | Good-Effort PR |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Title** | "Update README" | `docs(readme): clarify setup instructions` |
| **Description**| Empty or unclear | Includes summary, motivation, and test results |
| **Changes**| Random, unrelated edits | Solves a specific issue or adds value |
| **Communication**| No response to feedback | Actively engages in review |
| **Documentation**| Missing or incorrect | Updates docs where necessary |

-----

### Review Etiquette

#### As a Contributor

  * Be patient — maintainers may review on their own time.
  * Address review comments respectfully and with a positive attitude.
  * Don’t argue; discuss with reasoning and evidence.
  * Push updates as separate commits to make the review history transparent.

#### As a Reviewer

  * Focus on code, not the contributor.
  * Be specific and constructive with your feedback.
  * Acknowledge good work, not just mistakes.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
