# Introduction

Welcome to the **Real Contributions** section.

Having completed the **Get Started** section, you now have a foundational understanding of Git, GitHub, and standard contribution workflows. This next step will guide you in applying that knowledge to real-world open-source projects.

In this section, you will learn to:

- **Discover projects** that align with your skills and interests.
- **Navigate and comprehend existing codebases**, even if they are unfamiliar.
- Make **impactful contributions** that go beyond minor fixes.
- **Interact professionally** with project maintainers and the wider community.
- Review pull requests and provide **constructive feedback**.
- Adhere to **open-source etiquette** and evolve into a valued contributor.

> Making contributions to open-source is a broad endeavor. Contributions to documentation, effective issue reporting, and community support are all highly valued and equally important.

By the end of this section, you will have the knowledge and tools to transition from a beginner to a contributor who makes meaningful and recognized contributions to open-source projects.
