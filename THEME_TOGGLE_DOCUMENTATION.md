# Theme Toggle Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a light and dark mode toggle feature for the Open Source Wiki website.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Existing Theme Infrastructure
The project already had the necessary infrastructure for theme switching:
- **ThemeProvider** from next-themes in `app/layout.tsx`
- CSS variables for light and dark modes in `app/globals.css`
- The `.dark` class selector in CSS for dark mode styles

### 2. Theme Toggle Component
A new component was created at `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx` with the following features:
- Uses the `useTheme` hook from next-themes to get and set the current theme
- Displays a Sun icon in dark mode and a Moon icon in light mode
- Uses the existing Button component with the "ghost" variant for styling
- Positioned in the top-right corner of the screen
- Includes client-side mounting logic to prevent hydration mismatch

### 3. Integration
The ThemeToggle component was integrated into the application by:
- Importing it in `app/layout.tsx`
- Adding it inside the ThemeProvider but before the children element so it appears on all pages

## Usage
Users can now toggle between light and dark modes by clicking the theme toggle button in the top-right corner of any page. The button shows:
- A moon icon when in light mode (clicking it will switch to dark mode)
- A sun icon when in dark mode (clicking it will switch to light mode)

The theme preference is saved in local storage, so it persists between page refreshes and visits.

## Dependencies
The implementation uses the following dependencies that were already installed in the project:
- next-themes: For theme management
- lucide-react: For the Sun and Moon icons

No additional dependencies were required.
